Setup React JS
	-10Oct2021


=> Step 1: Install Pre Requirements:

Install Node.js
Install Visual Studio Code

=> Step 2: Create React JS Project & Setup

Create empty folder and open the folder from  VS Code

To start with project setup, go to the Terminal, run command 

> npm init.

This is how the folder structure will look like:

<react proj>\

	package.json   


=> Step 3: Install the necessary packages for reactjs:

>npm install react --save-dev
>npm install react-dom --save-dev
>npm install react-scripts --save-dev

=> Step 4: Create React JS Project

> npx create-react-app <my-app> 

Installation will get start and it will take some time.

=> Step 5. Create sample js and html files for first example

5.1 Create index.js under src folder 

index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
<h1>Hi, Welcome to NKXGEN!</h1>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);

5.2 Add index.html under public folder 

index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>First ReactJS Example</title> 
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id = "root"></div>
   </body>
</html>

=> Step 6: Configure project.json

project.json is a kind of manifest file for your application. This file plays a very important role in the react application development and deployment.

In short, we can say,

Package.json = Metadata associated with project + All Dependencies with version + scripts

You can see the package.json file in the react project structure.

You will find packge.json on node.js, npm application, Angular application, etc.

Add the command in package.json that will take care of using react-scripts to compile the code and start server as shown below:

 "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start" 
  }

O/p would be like below:

Package.json

{
  "name": "first",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.9.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.9.0",
    "react-scripts": "^3.1.1"
  }
}


Project Structure should like below

<reat proj folder>/

	 src/
	    index.js

	 node_modules/

	 public/
                index.html

	 package.json


=> Step 7: Run the Project

Go to the folder & run the project

> npm start 
or
> npm run start

Note : npm test, npm start, npm restart, and npm stop are all aliases for npm run xxx.

For all other scripts you define, you need to use the npm run xxx syntax.

Your application will get open in the browser. It should be hosted at 

http://localhost:3000/
